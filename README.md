<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Andy!</h2>
 
I am third-year student-athlete at Vanderbilt University studying Computer Science and Human & Organizational Development. I recently completed an Analytics & Data Science Internship with the [Trane Technologies](https://www.tranetechnologies.com) Residential HVAC and Supply Pricing Team, and was previously at <a href="https://burgundygroup.com/" target="_blank">Burgundy Group Advertising</a>. I am interested in the data science and advanced analytics space. This profile includes much of my publically published work.


For more information on my experience or if you would like to get in touch, I am available through my [![LinkedIn Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=flat&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.vandy.link/andy)
