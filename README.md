## Goal-geous Data

Analytics & Strategy @ [One Knoxville SC](https://github.com/OneKnoxvilleSC). 

Previously [Trane Technologies](https://tranetechnologies.com) and [Burgundy Group Advertising](https://burgundygroup.com).

I specialize in using data to inform growth strategy. I also enjoy soccer analytics and have experience working with event data, performance data, and building player scouting models. 

Currently finishing up my junior year studying Computer Science @ Vanderbilt University where I am a researcher with the STIR Lab. My research is on adolescent online risk under the domain of human-computer interaction.
